Tydi Specification License
==========================

This repository contains the [Tydi Specification License](license.txt). This
license is based upon
[Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), modified to
apply to specifications instead of software. The human-readable version is:

 - You are free to make (hardware) designs based on the Tydi specification and
   distribute them with any license you want, commercially or otherwise, for
   free, forever.

 - You are free to claim that your designs comply with the Tydi specification,
   and use the name Tydi for that purpose, even if we decide to trademark the
   name "Tydi" at some point. We will not verify for you that your design is
   compliant; instead, we trust you to do this yourself. In return, we promise
   not to go after you if you, accidentally or otherwise, claim compliance for
   a design that isn't *actually* compliant.

 - You are free to modify and distribute the specification itself, again under
   any license you want, commercially or otherwise, as long as you provide
   attribution to the original. This is the same as Apache 2.0. However, unlike
   Apache 2.0, you *have to change the name of the specification* to avoid
   confusion when someone claims to be "Tydi compliant."
